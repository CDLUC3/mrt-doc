# Merritt future brainstorming (6 July 2016)

## Stephen:

"Repository function completely independent of any implementation details"

"At the end of a year of hard work we don't want to end up with a
state-of-the-art repository from five years ago."

Individual scholars want deposit as easy as possible; curators want things
as descriptive as possible

Stephen's assertions / underlying environmental conditions (John C's not
interested)

- Too much stuff to treat anything the same
- Inherent value in large aggregations
- Avoid unnecessary data transfer
- Diverse customer needs
- Lots of storage is available
- Arbitrary graph structure

John C: "A common vocabulary around the features of a preservation
repository"

## Audience:

- Content producers
  - Researcher: lab scientist, digital humanist
    - operating as individuals in support of their own scholarship
  - Digitizer, licenser/licensee, archivist
    - working in an institutional context
  - Curators / collection managers
    - typically someone in a library (archive, historical society,
      museum...) digitizing part of a collection for preservation
    - sometimes collection development in the traditional sense,
      sometimes individuals who don't think of themselves as collection development
    - contrary to what one might think, libraries/curators aren't interested in
      getting out of the way so everybody can do self-deposit ("they want to
      keep their jobs")
  - examples
    - Lynn Grigsby at Berkeley, with a backlog of digitization
    - UCSD: sit down with researchers, talk about the files and about
      their needs, organize, stage, and submit files
- Repo managers
  - Us
  - Distinction between curators and producers
  - Stephen: "A curator is someone who accepts a stewardship responsibility
    ... someone who deals with these things as intellectual works"; a
    repository manager also accepts a stewardship responsibility, but in a
    technical sense, not an intellectual sense
  - John C: Content producers are writers, collection managers are editors,
      repo managers are publishers; publishers also see themselves as
      stewards (reprints, errata, etc.)
- Service providers
  - Libraries
  - Campus IT
  - Commercial vendors
- Consumers
  - could be anybody
- 99% of Merritt content is in private collections (some of which is a dark
  archive for public services)
  - "consumer" of the content could be a system, an API customer
    (Calisphere etc. only in disaster recovery scenario, but something like
    Dash on a daily basis)

## "Somebody goes to Merritt to do what?"

- deposit / upload
- store
- describe / tag / annotate
- incl. declare ownership
- arrange / organize
- collections, hierarchies, structures
- build relationships
- **re**arrange
- characterize (automated description)
- technical
- intellectual
- could incl. OCR, transcription...
- create derivatives
- find something
- search / browse / discover
- preview
- access / download
- annotate / comment / enhance
- "description by the consumer rather than the producer or the
  curator"
- validate
- in initial upload/stage
- fixity (ongoing)
- audit
- compliance
- manage (dashboard / mgmt tools)
- system reports
- activity
- status of other operations
- cost accounting
- delete / deaccession / weeding
- versions, history, etc.
- error handling
- integrity
- recovery
- handle large files, large numbers of files
- synchronous / asynchronous
- grant/deny permissions
- education
- guidance
- best practices
- transparency (a.k.a. what's the problem with Berkeley?)
- black box
- too big
- don't know what's in it
- can't see what's happening
- "we're expecting them to understand the whole process before they
  start"
- "we're expecting them to think like archivists"
- "you're sort of relying on the user... they create their own submission
  manifest, so there's lots of ways for them to make mistakes"
- "mostly they just have given up, and send \[Perry\] hard drives"
- "if there was a way to back out after things go wrong, that would
  help"
- API access
  - for update, manage, administer, etc. as well as find/access
