## Back story (Perry)

- Perry
  - working with UCSB on something similar
  - started out thinking we'd provide software to install
- David
  - need something w/less overhead on our side
  - Merritt can speak S3 or OpenStack
  - already looking at Minio w/SDSC, so that would be our recommendation

## UCSF

- NetApp + RHEL
  - something simple to install on RHEL would be good
  - can do some maintenance
- should be basically identical to original plan, just swapping Minio
  in for our JAR

## Action items

- David M. to email SDSC contact info to UCSF folks
