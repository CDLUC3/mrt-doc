# Deprecated Functionality

Functionality deprecated by the [Merritt Preservation System](https://github.com/CDLUC3/mrt-doc).

## Database Fields that are no longer actively used

### inv_nodes
- media_type 
- node_form
- node_protocol
- verify_on_read and verify_on_write
  - now controlled via the node table yaml
- source_node
- target_node

### inv_versions
- note 

### inv_collections
- read_privilege 
  - LDAP now controls this
- write_privilege 
  - LDAP now controls this
- download_privilege
  - LDAP now controls this
- storage_tier 
  - Not used.  Node table yaml is definitive.
- These values were likely intended to help choose the nodes in use

### Database Tables, Limited use
- inv_duas
- inv_dublinkernels - limited support in the Merritt UI, but this is part of the intended system design

### Database Enums, Limited use
- inv_nodes.media_connectivity only cloud is supported
- inv_files.source (consumer) - only system and producer are used
- inv_nodes.access_mode (some values) - off-line not currently used
- inv_nodes.access_protocol (some values) - currently all protocols are S3 but might change
- inv_nodes.external_provider - in reality, everything is using an S3 cloud api

## Merritt Admin Objects
- Collection: only used to partially populate inv_collections
- Owner: only used to minimally populate inv_owners
- SLA: not used
