# Versioning Use Cases

This document will describe key versioning use cases for a preservation repository to implement along with notes about how Merritt behaves with each use case.

It would eventually be interesting to see if these use cases could be useful to evaluate for other preservation repositories.

- Add Object Version 1
- Add Object Version 2 containing modified metadata
- Add Object Version 2 containing new bitstreams
- Add Object Version 2 containing modified bitstreams
- Add Object Version 2 containing RENAMED bitstreams (with identical content)
- Add Object Version 2 containing bitstream deletes
- Add Object Version 2 containing bitstream deletes; restore bitstream in version 3
- Create Object Version 2 without regard to the prior version of the object
- Delete object
- Change identifier for an object
